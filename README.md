# Quantitative-Methods-UCL

This repository includes the core part of my code written, by myself, for my final written investigation. It is a implementation to fit power-law-distributions to empirical data based on the article by (Clauset et al., 2009). My implementation is just as accurate as the one implemented by (Ornstein, 2011) but significately slower. However, the aim of the investigation was to use the methods in practice, and not to write highly optimized code.
